#+title: LoF Research Lab


** Goal
End-to-end Rama pipeline to crawl 185 LoF seed docs, normalize them, snapshot versions, and run long-running agentic research jobs on top. 

** Domain
** MVP Milestones
*** V1
Dumb topologies. Hardcoded URLs -> fetch -> normalize -> store -> simple search CLI.

*** V2
Add snapshotting, frontier expansion, link expansion.

*** V3
Add research job state machine: plan -> gather -> synthesize. Resumable jobs.

*** V4
Add minimal simulation harness for agent invariants.
