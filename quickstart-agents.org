Quickstart
This guide will get you up and running with Agent-o-rama in just a few minutes. You'll learn how to run examples locally and then deploy to a Rama cluster.

Running Examples Locally
The fastest way to try Agent-o-rama is to run the examples locally using InProcessCluster (IPC). This runs a complete Rama cluster in a single JVM process - perfect for development and testing.

The examples/ directory in the Agent-o-rama repo contains java/ and clj/ subfolders with lots of examples of agents. One of those examples is a simple ReAct agent that can search the web to answer questions. Below are instructions for running the Java or Clojure versions of that agent.

For both, the example will run an IPC cluster, launch the UI at http://localhost:1974, prompt you for a question, invoke the agent, and then print the result. The UI will remain open for viewing traces, performing more invokes, and other exploration until you press enter in the terminal.

This agent takes in a single list of messages as an argument, so to invoke from the UI give input of the form [["What is the 5th tallest mountain?"]].

Java Example
Prerequisites
Maven installed
OpenAI API key
Tavily API key (the free tier is sufficient)
Running the Example
Set up environment variables:

export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
export TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_key_here
Build and run the example:

cd examples/java
./run-example com.rpl.agent.react.ReActExample
Clojure Example
Prerequisites
Leiningen installed
OpenAI API key
Tavily API key (the free tier is sufficient)
Running the Example
Set up environment variables:

export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
export TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_key_here
Start a REPL:

cd examples/clj
lein repl
Load the example and run it:

(require '[com.rpl.agent.react :as react])
(react/run-agent)
Running on a Local Rama Cluster
For a more production-like experience, you can run Agent-o-rama on a local Rama cluster. This gives you the full distributed capabilities of Rama while running on your local machine.

Step 1: Download Rama
Download the latest Rama release from https://redplanetlabs.com/download and unpack it somewhere.

Step 2: Set Up a Local Rama Cluster
Run a single node cluster by running these commands:

./rama devZookeeper &
./rama conductor &
./rama supervisor &
This isn't a production-worthy setup – see the docs on setting up Rama clusters for more details. There are also one-click deploys available for AWS and for Azure.

Step 3: Download Agent-o-rama Release
Download the latest Agent-o-rama release from https://github.com/redplanetlabs/agent-o-rama/releases and unpack it.

Step 4: Start the Agent-o-rama UI
Launch the Agent-o-rama frontend:

./aor --rama /path/to/rama-root &
The UI will be available at http://localhost:1974.

Step 5: Build and Deploy Your Module
Build an uberjar witn your module code. To do so for the examples:

# For Java projects  
cd examples/java
mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true

# For Clojure projects
cd examples/clj
lein uberjar
Deploy the module to your local Rama cluster using the Rama CLI:

# Navigate to your Rama installation
cd /path/to/rama-root

# Deploy the module (Java uberjar)
./rama deploy \
  --action launch \
  --jar /path/to/your-module.jar \
  --module com.rpl.agent.react.ReActModule \
  --tasks 4 \
  --threads 2 \
  --workers 1

# Deploy the module (Clojure uberjar)
./rama deploy \
  --action launch \
  --jar /path/to/your-module.jar \
  --module com.rpl.agent.react/ReActModule \
  --tasks 4 \
  --threads 2 \
  --workers 1
This agent takes in a single list of messages as an argument, so to invoke from the UI give input of the form [["What is the 5th tallest mountain?"]].

Next Steps
Now that you have a module deployed you can play with it in the UI by invoking the module from the web interface, exploring traces, building datasets, running experiments, and viewing analytics.
